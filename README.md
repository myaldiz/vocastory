## Problem Statement
- People struggle to memorise words effectively while learning a new language or preparing for an exam. Existing systems mostly rely on repetition without  letting users actively put the words they learn into a context

## How to RUN the website
- Please read the mystory/README.md



## Tasks

- We have three different modes in the game explained below as tasks:
    - Task 1 (Write): Write a sentence by using a word from the word list, with the intent of continuing the story
        - This feature is called ``writer's mode``
        - Multiple responses collected from different users.
    - Task 2 (Pick): Choose the best sentence (creative+fits in with the previous ones)
        - This feature is called ``reader's mode``
        - Winner will be selected as a next sentence to continue the story.
        - Next, users switch back to writing mode to continue the story. (Exact mechanism will be selected by user study in the future)
    - Task 3 (Review): Review and grade the story as a whole based on the provided criteria (uniqueness, sentence qualities, coherence)
        - This feature is called ``reviewer's mode``
